   <h1>Expressions</h1>

   <p class="simpara">
    Expressions are the most important building blocks of PHP.  In PHP,
    almost anything you write is an expression.  The simplest yet
    most accurate way to define an expression is &quot;anything that has a
    value&quot;.
   </p>
   <p class="simpara">
    The most basic forms of expressions are constants and variables.
    When you type <code class="code">$a = 5</code>, you&#039;re assigning <code class="code">5</code> into
    <var class="varname">$a</var>.  <code class="code">5</code>, obviously,
    has the value 5, or in other words <code class="code">5</code> is an expression with the
    value of 5 (in this case, <code class="code">5</code> is an integer constant).
   </p>
   <p class="simpara">
    After this assignment, you&#039;d expect <var class="varname">$a</var>&#039;s value to be 5 as
    well, so if you wrote <code class="code">$b = $a</code>, you&#039;d expect it to behave just as
    if you wrote <code class="code">$b = 5</code>.  In other words, <var class="varname">$a</var> is an expression with the
    value of 5 as well.  If everything works right, this is exactly
    what will happen.
   </p>
   <p class="para">
    Slightly more complex examples for expressions are functions.  For
    instance, consider the following function:
    <div class="informalexample">
     <div class="example-contents">
<div class="phpcode"><code><span style="color: #000000">
<span style="color: #0000BB">&lt;?php<br /></span><span style="color: #007700">function </span><span style="color: #0000BB">foo </span><span style="color: #007700">()<br />{<br />    return </span><span style="color: #0000BB">5</span><span style="color: #007700">;<br />}<br /></span><span style="color: #0000BB">?&gt;</span>
</span>
</code></div>
     </div>

    </div>
   </p>
   <p class="simpara">
    Assuming you&#039;re familiar with the concept of functions (if you&#039;re
    not, take a look at the chapter about <a href="language.functions.html" class="link">functions</a>), you&#039;d assume
    that typing <code class="code">$c = foo()</code> is essentially just like
    writing <code class="code">$c = 5</code>, and you&#039;re right.  Functions
    are expressions with the value of their return value.  Since <code class="code">foo()</code>
    returns 5, the value of the expression &#039;<code class="code">foo()</code>&#039; is 5.  Usually
    functions don&#039;t just return a static value but compute something.
   </p>
   <p class="simpara">
    Of course, values in PHP don&#039;t have to be integers, and very often
    they aren&#039;t.  PHP supports four scalar value types: <span class="type">int</span>
    values, floating point values (<span class="type">float</span>), <span class="type">string</span>
    values and <span class="type">bool</span> values (scalar values are values that you
    can&#039;t &#039;break&#039; into smaller pieces, unlike arrays, for instance). PHP also 
    supports two composite (non-scalar) types: arrays and objects. Each of
    these value types can be assigned into variables or returned from functions.
   </p>
   <p class="simpara">
    PHP takes expressions much further, in the same way many other languages
    do.  PHP is an expression-oriented language, in the
    sense that almost everything is an expression.  Consider the
    example we&#039;ve already dealt with, <code class="code">$a = 5</code>.  It&#039;s easy to see that
    there are two values involved here, the value of the integer
    constant <code class="code">5</code>, and the value of <var class="varname">$a</var> which is being updated to 5 as
    well.  But the truth is that there&#039;s one additional value involved
    here, and that&#039;s the value of the assignment itself.  The
    assignment itself evaluates to the assigned value, in this case 5.
    In practice, it means that <code class="code">$a = 5</code>, regardless of what it does,
    is an expression with the value 5.  Thus, writing something like
    <code class="code">$b = ($a = 5)</code> is like writing
    <code class="code">$a = 5; $b = 5;</code> (a semicolon
    marks the end of a statement).  Since assignments are parsed in a
    right to left order, you can also write <code class="code">$b = $a = 5</code>.
   </p>
   <p class="simpara">
    Another good example of expression orientation is pre- and
    post-increment and decrement.  Users of PHP and many other
    languages may be familiar with the notation of <code class="code">variable++</code> and
    <code class="code">variable--</code>.  These are <a href="language.operators.increment.html" class="link">
    increment and decrement operators</a>.  In PHP, like in C, there
    are two types of increment - pre-increment and post-increment.
    Both pre-increment and post-increment essentially increment the
    variable, and the effect on the variable is identical.  The
    difference is with the value of the increment expression.
    Pre-increment, which is written <code class="code">++$variable</code>, evaluates to the
    incremented value (PHP increments the variable before reading its
    value, thus the name &#039;pre-increment&#039;).  Post-increment, which is
    written <code class="code">$variable++</code> evaluates to the original value of
    <var class="varname">$variable</var>, before it was incremented (PHP increments the variable
    after reading its value, thus the name &#039;post-increment&#039;).
   </p>
   <p class="simpara">
    A very common type of expressions are <a href="language.operators.comparison.html" class="link">comparison</a>
    expressions. These expressions evaluate to either  <strong><code>false</code></strong> or <strong><code>true</code></strong>. PHP
    supports &gt; (bigger than), &gt;= (bigger than or equal to), == (equal),
    != (not equal), &lt; (smaller than) and &lt;= (smaller than or equal to).
    The language also supports a set of strict equivalence operators: ===
    (equal to and same type) and !== (not equal to or not same type).
    These expressions are most commonly used inside conditional execution,
    such as <code class="code">if</code> statements.
   </p>
   <p class="simpara">
    The last example of expressions we&#039;ll deal with here is combined
    operator-assignment expressions.  You already know that if you
    want to increment <var class="varname">$a</var> by 1, you can simply write
    <code class="code">$a++</code> or <code class="code">++$a</code>.
    But what if you want to add more than one to it, for instance 3?
    You could write <code class="code">$a++</code> multiple times, but this
    is obviously not a very efficient or comfortable way.  A much more
    common practice is to write <code class="code">$a =
    $a + 3</code>.  <code class="code">$a + 3</code> evaluates
    to the value of <var class="varname">$a</var> plus 3, and is assigned back
    into <var class="varname">$a</var>, which results in incrementing <var class="varname">$a</var>
    by 3.  In PHP, as in several other languages like C, you can write this
    in a shorter way, which with time would become clearer and quicker to
    understand as well. Adding 3 to the current value of <var class="varname">$a</var>
    can be written <code class="code">$a += 3</code>.  This means exactly
    &quot;take the value of <var class="varname">$a</var>, add 3 to it, and assign it
    back into <var class="varname">$a</var>&quot;. In addition to being shorter and
    clearer, this also results in faster execution.  The value of
    <code class="code">$a += 3</code>, like the value of a regular assignment, is
    the assigned value. Notice that it is NOT 3, but the combined value
    of <var class="varname">$a</var> plus 3 (this is the value that&#039;s
    assigned into <var class="varname">$a</var>).  Any two-place operator can be used
    in this operator-assignment mode, for example <code class="code">$a -= 5</code>
    (subtract 5 from the value of <var class="varname">$a</var>), <code class="code">$b *= 7</code>
    (multiply the value of <var class="varname">$b</var> by 7), etc.
   </p>
   <p class="para">
    There is one more expression that may seem odd if you haven&#039;t seen
    it in other languages, the ternary conditional operator:
   </p>
   <p class="para">
    <div class="informalexample">
     <div class="example-contents">
<div class="phpcode"><code><span style="color: #000000">
<span style="color: #0000BB">&lt;?php<br />$first </span><span style="color: #007700">? </span><span style="color: #0000BB">$second </span><span style="color: #007700">: </span><span style="color: #0000BB">$third<br />?&gt;</span>
</span>
</code></div>
     </div>

    </div>
   </p>
   <p class="para">
    If the value of the first subexpression is <strong><code>true</code></strong> (non-zero), then
    the second subexpression is evaluated, and that is the result of
    the conditional expression. Otherwise, the third subexpression is
    evaluated, and that is the value.
   </p>
   <p class="para">
    The following example should help you understand pre- and
    post-increment and expressions in general a bit better:
   </p>
   <p class="para">
    <div class="informalexample">
     <div class="example-contents">

   <p class="simpara">
    Some expressions can be considered as statements. In
    this case, a statement has the form of &#039;<code class="code">expr ;</code>&#039; that is, an
    expression followed by a semicolon.  In <code class="code">$b = $a = 5;</code>,
    <code class="code">$a = 5</code> is a valid expression, but it&#039;s not a statement
    by itself. <code class="code">$b = $a = 5;</code>, however, is a valid statement.
   </p>
   <p class="simpara">
    One last thing worth mentioning is the truth value of expressions.
    In many events, mainly in conditional execution and loops, you&#039;re
    not interested in the specific value of the expression, but only
    care about whether it means <strong><code>true</code></strong> or <strong><code>false</code></strong>.
    
    
    
    The constants <strong><code>true</code></strong> and <strong><code>false</code></strong> (case-insensitive) are the two 
    possible boolean values. When necessary, an expression is 
    automatically converted to boolean. See the 
    <a href="language.types.type-juggling.html#language.types.typecasting" class="link">section about
    type-casting</a> for details about how.

   <p class="simpara">
    PHP provides a full and powerful implementation of expressions, and
    documenting it entirely goes beyond the scope of this manual. The
    above examples should give you a good idea about what expressions
    are and how you can construct useful expressions. Throughout the
    rest of this manual we&#039;ll write <var class="varname">expr</var>
    to indicate any valid PHP expression.
