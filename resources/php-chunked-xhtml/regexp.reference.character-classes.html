  <p class="para">
   An opening square bracket introduces a character class,
   terminated  by  a  closing  square  bracket.  A  closing square
   bracket on its own is  not  special.  If  a  closing  square
   bracket  is  required as a member of the class, it should be
   the first data character in the class (after an initial
   circumflex, if present) or escaped with a backslash.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   A character class matches a single character in the subject;
   the  character  must  be in the set of characters defined by
   the class, unless the first character in the class is a
   circumflex,  in which case the subject character must not be in
   the set defined by the class. If a  circumflex  is  actually
   required  as  a  member  of  the class, ensure it is not the
   first character, or escape it with a backslash.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   For example, the character class [aeiou] matches  any  lower
   case vowel, while [^aeiou] matches any character that is not
   a lower case vowel. Note that a circumflex is  just  a
   convenient  notation for specifying the characters which are in
   the class by enumerating those that are not. It  is  not  an
   assertion:  it  still  consumes a character from the subject
   string, and fails if the current pointer is at  the  end  of
   the string.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   When case-insensitive (caseless) matching is set, any letters
   in a class represent both their upper case and lower case
   versions, so for example, an insensitive [aeiou] matches &quot;A&quot;
   as well as &quot;a&quot;, and an insensitive [^aeiou] does not match
   &quot;A&quot;, whereas a sensitive (caseful) version would.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   The newline character is never treated in any special way in
   character  classes,  whatever the setting of the <a href="reference.pcre.pattern.modifiers.html" class="link">PCRE_DOTALL</a>
   or <a href="reference.pcre.pattern.modifiers.html" class="link">PCRE_MULTILINE</a>
   options is. A class such as [^a] will always match a newline.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   The minus (hyphen) character can be used to specify a  range
   of  characters  in  a  character  class.  For example, [d-m]
   matches any letter between d and m, inclusive.  If  a  minus
   character  is required in a class, it must be escaped with a
   backslash or appear in a position where it cannot be
   interpreted as indicating a range, typically as the first or last
   character in the class.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   It is not possible to have the literal character &quot;]&quot; as  the
   end  character  of  a  range.  A  pattern such as [W-]46] is
   interpreted as a class of two characters (&quot;W&quot; and &quot;-&quot;)
   followed by a literal string &quot;46]&quot;, so it would match &quot;W46]&quot; or
   &quot;-46]&quot;. However, if the &quot;]&quot; is escaped with a  backslash  it
   is  interpreted  as  the end of range, so [W-\]46] is
   interpreted as a single class containing a range followed by  two
   separate characters. The octal or hexadecimal representation
   of &quot;]&quot; can also be used to end a range.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Ranges operate in ASCII collating sequence. They can also be
   used  for  characters  specified  numerically,  for  example
   [\000-\037]. If a range that includes letters is  used  when
   case-insensitive (caseless)  matching  is set, it matches the
   letters in either case. For example, [W-c] is equivalent  to
   [][\^_`wxyzabc], matched case-insensitively, and if character
   tables for the &quot;fr&quot; locale are in use, [\xc8-\xcb] matches
   accented E characters in both cases.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   The character types \d, \D, \s, \S,  \w,  and  \W  may  also
   appear  in  a  character  class, and add the characters that
   they match to the class. For example, [\dABCDEF] matches any
   hexadecimal  digit.  A  circumflex  can conveniently be used
   with the upper case character types to specify a  more
   restricted set of characters than the matching lower case type.
   For example, the class [^\W_] matches any letter  or  digit,
   but not underscore.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   All non-alphanumeric characters other than \,  -,  ^  (at  the
   start)  and  the  terminating ] are non-special in character
   classes, but it does no harm if they are escaped. The pattern
   terminator is always special and must be escaped when used
   within an expression.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Perl supports the POSIX notation for character classes. This uses names
   enclosed by <code class="literal">[:</code> and <code class="literal">:]</code> within the enclosing square brackets. PCRE also
   supports this notation. For example, <code class="literal">[01[:alpha:]%]</code>
   matches &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, any alphabetic character, or &quot;%&quot;. The supported class
   names are:
   <table class="doctable table">
    <caption><strong>Character classes</strong></caption>
    
     <tbody class="tbody">
      <tr><td><code class="literal">alnum</code></td><td>letters and digits</td></tr>

      <tr><td><code class="literal">alpha</code></td><td>letters</td></tr>

      <tr><td><code class="literal">ascii</code></td><td>character codes 0 - 127</td></tr>

      <tr><td><code class="literal">blank</code></td><td>space or tab only</td></tr>

      <tr><td><code class="literal">cntrl</code></td><td>control characters</td></tr>

      <tr><td><code class="literal">digit</code></td><td>decimal digits (same as \d)</td></tr>

      <tr><td><code class="literal">graph</code></td><td>printing characters, excluding space</td></tr>

      <tr><td><code class="literal">lower</code></td><td>lower case letters</td></tr>

      <tr><td><code class="literal">print</code></td><td>printing characters, including space</td></tr>

      <tr><td><code class="literal">punct</code></td><td>printing characters, excluding letters and digits</td></tr>

      <tr><td><code class="literal">space</code></td><td>white space (not quite the same as \s)</td></tr>

      <tr><td><code class="literal">upper</code></td><td>upper case letters</td></tr>

      <tr><td><code class="literal">word</code></td><td>&quot;word&quot; characters (same as \w)</td></tr>

      <tr><td><code class="literal">xdigit</code></td><td>hexadecimal digits</td></tr>

     </tbody>
    
   </table>

   The <code class="literal">space</code> characters are HT (9), LF (10), VT (11), FF (12), CR (13),
   and space (32). Notice that this list includes the VT character (code
   11). This makes &quot;space&quot; different to <code class="literal">\s</code>, which does not include VT (for
   Perl compatibility).
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   The name <code class="literal">word</code> is a Perl extension, and <code class="literal">blank</code> is a GNU extension
   from Perl 5.8. Another Perl extension is negation, which is indicated
   by a <code class="literal">^</code> character after the colon. For example,
   <code class="literal">[12[:^digit:]]</code> matches &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, or any non-digit.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   In UTF-8 mode, characters with values greater than 128 do not match any
   of the POSIX character classes.
   As of libpcre 8.10 some character classes are changed to use
   Unicode character properties, in which case the mentioned restriction does
   not apply. Refer to the <a href="http://www.pcre.org/pcre.txt" class="link external">&raquo;&nbsp;PCRE(3) manual</a>
   for details.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   Unicode character properties can appear inside a character class. They can
   not be part of a range. The minus (hyphen) character after a Unicode
   character class will match literally. Trying to end a range with a Unicode
   character property will result in a warning.
