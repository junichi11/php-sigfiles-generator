  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p class="simpara">
   PHP is a powerful language and the interpreter, whether included
   in a web server as a module or executed as a separate
   <acronym title="Common Gateway Interface">CGI</acronym> binary, is able to access files, execute
   commands and open network connections on the server.  These
   properties make anything run on a web server insecure by default.
   PHP is designed specifically to be a more secure language for
   writing <acronym title="Common Gateway Interface">CGI</acronym> programs than Perl or C, and with correct selection of
   compile-time and runtime configuration options, and proper coding
   practices, it can give you exactly the combination of freedom and
   security you need.
  </p>
  <p class="simpara">
   As there are many different ways of utilizing PHP, there are many
   configuration options controlling its behaviour.  A large
   selection of options guarantees you can use PHP for a lot of
   purposes, but it also means there are combinations of these
   options and server configurations that result in an insecure
   setup.
  </p>
  <p class="simpara">
   The configuration flexibility of PHP is equally rivalled by the
   code flexibility. PHP can be used to build complete server
   applications, with all the power of a shell user, or it can be used
   for simple server-side includes with little risk in a tightly
   controlled environment. How you build that environment, and how
   secure it is, is largely up to the PHP developer.
  </p>
  <p class="simpara">
   This chapter starts with some general security advice, explains
   the different configuration option combinations and the situations
   they can be safely used, and describes different considerations in
   coding for different levels of security.
